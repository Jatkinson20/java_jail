This project would not be possible without the package
com.sun.tools.example.trace, written by Robert Field. 
http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/com/sun/tools/example/trace/package-index.html
The traceprinter package was initially created from that package. 

Try the visualizer this was built for:

== traceprinter.JSONTrace ==
This is the main class. If you call

"java traceprinter.JSONTrace ClassName"

it will start up a debugger (tracer) JVM, then a debugee JVM, and
output the full state of the variables and call stack as the program
executes. It is necessary that the class being traced (ClassName)
was compiled with the -g option.

The class

The output format is described here:
  https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/v3/docs/opt-trace-format.md
This allows us to use the javascript frontend from OnlinePythonTutor
to visualize Java instead of Python. 

See ./compile and ../../README for information on compiling and testing.

== traceprinter.JSONTracingThread ==
This file detemines how to process events from the debugger VM. 

== traceprinter.JDI2JSON ==
This file takes JDI mirrors of the running process and converts them to
JSON format.
